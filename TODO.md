Stuff to do:

- [ ] check memory usage with the new windows
- [ ] check memory usage after destroying windows; is EventBus holding references?
- [ ] EventBus:Unregister is doing nothing
- [ ] refactor Presenter, it is:
  - managing state
  - managing database
  - handling events
  - printing bars
- [ ] refactor UI, I think ScrollFrame could move into its own module
- [ ] attaching the Name of the player being inspected to UIHeader (this will look epic cute)
- [ ] validate DiameterDB and make sure there's no stray data
- [ ] DiameterDB migration: we need to clear the database for people still in v1.x.x
- [ ] EventBus has now Diameter.EventBus for global and Diameter.EventBusClass to create instances. I don't like it :-(
- [ ] change all the "Diameter.Module" into only "Module."
- [ ] ponder: is GetTime() a good identifier for windows?
- [ ] ponder: unit testing. Do we even have those in wow lua addon development?
- [ ] UI improvements: it is a bit ugly now, specially the bar colors
- [ ] customization: for starters, allow users to set bar height
- [ ] in Presenter obj.playerList is instanced but it maybe could be class-wide OR it could consider the data without secrets
- [ ] Menu.lua has a weird parameter being passed, I think it's ID and it's not being used. Ponder removal
