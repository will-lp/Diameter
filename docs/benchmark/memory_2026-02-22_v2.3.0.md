A new BarPool module was written and let's put it to test.

  - profiling:
/run collectgarbage("collect") UpdateAddOnMemoryUsage() print(GetAddOnMemoryUsage("Diameter"))


conclusions:
so far, it seems okay. it grows once new windows are added but doesn't reduce a lot
so old behaviour is still around.
