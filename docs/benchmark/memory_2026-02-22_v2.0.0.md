Concerning memory usage: much nastier than I thought. I had no clue Frames are not GC'd. 
So far opening and closing 5 windows 3 times bumped memory usage to 320 kb. Could pool frames 
with Recycler, but feels like over-engineering it. I'll monitor with a dungeon run. Probably 
players won't open 97 windows. Probably. Gotta remember Bars are pooled already.

  - profiling:
    /run collectgarbage("collect") UpdateAddOnMemoryUsage() print(GetAddOnMemoryUsage("Diameter"))
  - count frames:
    /run local count = 0 for i=1, 1000 do if _G["DiameterWindow"..i] then count = count + 1 end end print("Frames in memory: " .. count)

Below, a follower run was done to averiguate the state of memory usage. So far, we can see memory usage
grows with extra windows, but doesn't shrink when extra windows are closed. The leak is around 10-13 kb 
per window, though, and at 6 windows and 300 kb of usage, the screen gets insanely bloated and with a huge
information overload. 

After this run I decided to leave memory as is. It doesn't waste enough memory to be a concern.
If the addon grows huge then we might have to take a look at recycling frames, but not in the current state.
For now, no action will be taken.
